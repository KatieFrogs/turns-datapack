## Turns datapack for Minecraft
Multiplayer datapack where all the players control a single character one by one. Anybody can send `/trigger t` in chat to request an 18 second turn.

**Requires the [Carpet mod](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet) for the [/player](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/wiki/Commands#player) command**

### Known issues
- Items are lost if the turn ends while a player is dragging or crafting them
- Beds do not work

### Credits
- A modified version of the [Shared Hearts](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/shared-hearts/) datapack by -LEO- is used
